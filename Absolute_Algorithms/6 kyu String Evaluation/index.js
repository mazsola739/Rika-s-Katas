/*
Evaluate the given string with the given conditons.

The conditions will be passed in an array and will be formatted like this:

{symbol or digit}{comparison operator}{symbol or digit}

Return the results in an array.

The characters in the conditions will always be in the string. Characters in the string are chosen from ascii letters + @#$%^&*()_{}[]
Example

input string: "aab#HcCcc##l#"
conditions: ["a<b", "#==4", "c>=C", "H!=a"]

The conditions in this example array can be interpreted as:

    "a<b": The number of times "a" occurs in the string should be less than the number of times "b" occurs in the string
    "#==4": "#" should occur exactly 4 times in the string
    "c>=C": "c" should occur greater than or equal to the number of times "C" occurs
    "H!=a": The number of times "H" occurs should not equal the number of times "a" occurs

In this example condition 1 is false and 2, 3, 4 are true. So the return value will be an array as such:

[False, True, True, True]
