Description:

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

*/

//My solution

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  return arr1.concat(arr2).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
