/*
Description:

In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

The function needs to return either a true or false.

Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

Floats are considered UNeven for this kata.

*/

//My solution

function testEven(n) {
  return n % 2 === 0;
}
