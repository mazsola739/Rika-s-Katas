Description:
Kata Task

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

    humanYears >= 1
    humanYears are whole numbers only

Cat Years

    15 cat years for first year
    +9 cat years for second year
    +4 cat years for each year after that

Dog Years

    15 dog years for first year
    +9 dog years for second year
    +5 dog years for each year after that

//My solution

var humanYearsCatYearsDogYears = function (humanYears) {
  let catYears = 0;
  let dogYears = 0;
  if (humanYears === 1) {
    catYears = 15;
    dogYears = 15;
  } else if (humanYears === 2) {
    catYears = 15 + 9;
    dogYears = 15 + 9;
  } else if (humanYears >= 3) {
    catYears = 15 + 9 + (humanYears - 2) * 4;
    dogYears = 15 + 9 + (humanYears - 2) * 5;
  }
  return [humanYears, catYears, dogYears];
};
